# Hey 👋, I am shaynlink aka Rayane Guemmoud

I am a passionate developer for +7 years, I have started with PHP in learning how to program a website, but I was too young for understanding why PHP not working without server 🫡.

I am Javascript expert I use for my current projects -> `TypeScript`, `JavaScript`, `Golang` and `ReactJS` / `NextJS`, `Rust`

## List of my projects
### Closed Unit Federation System - CUFS
**CUFS** Is a concept of Semi-Decentralization service and data management based on no-trust, For each service like authentication is closed on an own centralized system named Unit and no share any data without authorization, even Developer.
Example if I have an App. And I want to connecte to my account, you need to call Authentification Unit to get specific data, my App cannot get data without autorization, even if is the same project. For developing an Unit, each key / certificate is given and controled by system, and for production each keys / certificat is randomized and rotate automatically and inaccessible without authorization by service.

### Online service and Open-Source
[Argus 📡] - A Powerful Web-Monitor, can ping / test HTTP, WS, MQTT e.g .., but even every protocol using TCP / UDP, you can write your own script of TCP / UDP.\
[Dishard.js] - A layer of Discord.js using ShardManager over internet.
